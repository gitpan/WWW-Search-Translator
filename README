Translator.pm Version 1.02.


This is a simple no thrills class enabling users to translate
text through AV Translations F<http://babel.altavista.com>.
This translating via this method seems much faster than thru
browser interface. Makes a neat addition to any web page. 
Translated text is returned thru $result->raw, there is no
url's or title $results like typical WWW::Search results, just
a stream of text that was translated from the query text entered.

SEE TRANSLATION OPTIONS and TIPS.

This class exports no public interface; all interaction should
be done through WWW::Search objects.




See Also WWW::Search documentation. For all the latest
current fixed backends see:
